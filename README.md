# MEDICAMENT


## Inspiration
The scarcity of medicine has intensified during these catastrophic times, resulting in a unfair pricing system. Hoarding of medicine and distribution problems have disrupted everyone's lives, producing a sense of panic and powerlessness in an emergency situation. We wondered if there could be a place where we could resolve this growing concern.
## What it does
System for prescribing drugs in hospitals and their substitutes' availability in local/city medical shops. E-consultation with certified doctors, online prescriptions, checking pharmaceutical availability and relevant information, and a mental health tracker are all available through this interactive website.
##Process
By attaching the drive and implementing a backup system, you may automatically sync with the pharmacy's inventory. A database of medicine has been included. Pharmacy owners must choose the medicine based on what is available in their stores, and they can update it once a day to maintain a decent level of accuracy.
 On the website, a review mechanism is implemented. The patient can read about doctors' basic experiences, as well as rank and view them. As the patients reveal their personal information, this will develop a sense of trust in them.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP and MySQL for the backend. Translation APIs, Distance Matrix APIs, and Geolocation APIs have all been used.
## Challenges we ran into
To automatically sync each pharmacy's local database with the inventory on the website. To search an accurate medical database that has all of the necessary information, such as drugs, their alternatives, side effects, salts, prices, and companies.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had to learn several languages in order to implement the idea and add new features. To develop new features, we needed to conduct a thorough market analysis. 
We are proud that we have successfully integrated our palette of thoughts and ideas into an interactive website.
## What we learned
We learned a variety of abilities, including collaboration and teamwork. As we outsourced every duty of the hackathon , from the first features to the final structure , we learned the importance of working as part of a team to successfully make the website which will cater to today's needs.   
## What's next for Medicament
Prescription verification using ML & AI  ,  Health tracker that will include BP , weight , fasting sugar and  BMI index , Nutrition Chart
