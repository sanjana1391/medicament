# medicament

## Inspiration
India continues to struggle with providing basic medical care for its citizens. It is estimated that 600 million people in India are with little or no access to healthcare. These pandemic times have increased the shortage of medicine which leads to colossal pricing system. Hoarding of medicine and malfunctioning in the distribution has caused disruption in everyone's life creating a situation of panic and helplessness in emergency situation.

## What it does
System for prescribing drug in hospitals and its or its substitute availability in the medical shops of the area/city. E-consultation with registered doctors , online prescription , Check medicine availability and information related to them and mental health tracker.

## Process
Auto sync with pharmacies inventory by linking drive and creating backup system . An Indian Medicine Database has been added . Pharmacy ownwers have to choose the medicine according to the availibility in their shops and can update it once a day to get a resonable accuracy.

A review base system is indroduced on the website. The patient can read basic experience of doctors and and can rate and view them. This will instill a sense of trust in the patients as they share their personal information.

## How we built it
For the frontend, we have used HTML,CSS,JAVASCRRIPT and for the backend PHP,MYSQL . We have used Translation API's , Distance Matrix and Geolocation API's.

## Challenges we ran into
To auto sync local database of pharmacies to the inventory of website for each pharmacy.  To search authentic medical database having all the information which includes medicines, their substitutes ,side effects ,salts and companies .

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
